# Tic Tac Toe running on Pepper

Application for playing Tic Tac Toe against Pepper with simple game logic, computer vision and human-robot interaction components. The included Dockerfile allows to run everything in a pre-built container without the need to install Python2.7, NaoQi 2.5 and OpenCV 3.4. The environment variables `PEPPER_IP` and `PEPPER_PW` should be changed. This repository has been created for a workshop at the 37th Bundeswettbewerb Informatik BWINF.


## Requirements

The following software must be installed beforehand:

+ Docker Engine >= v16 (current version v18.09 recommended)
	+ An installation guide for any operating system can be found on the [Docker
		Docs](https://docs.docker.com/install/)


## Prepare Pepper

```bash
$ ssh nao@[PEPPER_IP]
# nao stop
# naoqi-bin --disable-life
```

## Play TicTacToe

1. Print or Draw a black Tic Tac Toe field with rather thick edges
2. Place Pepper at roughly 40cm distance in front of the field
3. Launch web server to host the game field that is retrieved by Peppers tablet
4. Launch VNC and see if field is clearly visible by Peppers camera
5. (Launch image server to see debug CV images)
5. Launch game


## Development Guide

So that we can start programming, we first need the version control software `Git`. An installation guide can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/de/v1/Los-geht%E2%80%99s-Git-installieren).

Clone the repository naoqi-opencv-tictactoe with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kw90/naoqi-opencv-tictactoe.git
```
and navigate into the folder

```bash
cd naoqi-opencv-tictactoe-dev
```

Inside this folder the container can be built using

```bash
docker build -t naoqi-opencv-tictactoe-dev:latest .
```

This will pull the Docker image from the Docker Hub, copy the
TicTacToe folder and sets the command `python Main.py` as the
Launch order.

Then the container can be started by running,

```bash
docker run -it --network host naoqi-opencv-tictactoe-dev:latest
```

which runs  the Python `Main.py` program on the specified Pepper in the `Dockerfile`.

To run a different program inside the container, it can be specified after the container image description

```bash
docker run -it --network host naoqi-opencv-tictactoe-dev:latest python DetectBoard.py
```

If something has been modified in the TicTacToe application, you can simply use the two commands

```bash
docker build -t naoqi-opencv-tictactoe-dev:latest .
docker run -it --network host naoqi-opencv-tictactoe-dev:latest
```

to rebuild and rerun the container.

### More convenient way

For more convenient development, the source directory `TicTacToe` can be mounted inside the container and started with a simple shell as entrypoint

```bash
docker run -it -v `pwd`/TicTacToe:/naoqi/src/tic-tac-toe --entrypoint /bin/sh --network host naoqi-opencv-tictactoe-dev:latest
```
This method allows to modify files on the Host machine using a preferred text editor and run them inside the container by running the Python program on the Docker shell, e.g. simply

```bash
python Main.py
```
